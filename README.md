### Introduction 

The repo contains the motor control code from Arduino. These motors are joint motors for Rhino XR4 robotic arm. 

I wrote those ocdes during my final year on graduation. Anyone can use them as they like. 


Please remember that I use 'Serial' communication heavily to commincate to a LabVIEW VI that acted as a frontend.
