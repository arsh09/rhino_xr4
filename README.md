### Introduction 

The repo contains the motor control code from Arduino. These motors are joint motors for Rhino XR4 robotic arm. 

I wrote those code during my final year for my graduation thesis. 

Please remember that I use 'Serial' communication heavily to commincate to a LabVIEW VI that acted as a frontend.
